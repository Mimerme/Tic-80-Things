## Tweening Libraries
**tween.js** - Deprecated tweening engine. Focused mainly on tweening Tic-80 sprites and their positions. But it's still here since some of the code is reusable

**tween_vars.js** - Tweens the actual variables instead of just the sprites. **NOTE:** since Javascript cannot inherently pass variables by reference there is a hacky replacement as a workaround. I will go into further detail down bellow
